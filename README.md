# 1.2.10 Madlib Project
## Approach
My approach in this project was to do as much as I could with the help of the PLTW book. Using some of the methods and code we have learned from the book in the past, especially .substring() and .indexOf(), I created this program that was able to replace parts of a madlib with a 2 user inputted nouns, a plural noun, an adjective, and a verb. Below is my codes functionality.
