# 1.2.10 Madlib Project
## Approach
My approach in this project was to do as much as I could with the help of the PLTW book. Using all of the methods and code we have learned from the book in the past, and with the help of the .replace() method, I created this program that was able to replace parts of a madlib with a user inputted noun, plural noun, adjective, verb, and finally an integer. Below is my code and pictures of its functionality.
